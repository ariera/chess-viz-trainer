# Chess Visualization Trainer

`chess-viz-trainer` is a toolset which aims to help users improve their overall chess skills through focused practice and challenges.

Chess visualization refers to the ability to picture the chessboard and the movement of the pieces in one's mind without the need to physically see the board. This skill is crucial for chess players as it allows them to plan strategies and anticipate their opponent's moves ahead of time, even without looking at an actual board.


## Exercises
### Knight moves

The primary goal is for users to find the shortest path a knight can take between two specified squares on a chessboard.

This exercise should help the user improve their spatial reasoning and pattern recognition.

### Captures & Checks

You are provided with a sequence of moves in standard algebraic notation and a starting board position. Without physically moving the pieces on the board, you must visualize the resulting position after these moves have been played. The challenge then is to identify and count the number of captures and checks available to the player whose turn is next.
